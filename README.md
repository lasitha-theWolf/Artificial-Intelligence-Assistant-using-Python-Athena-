# Artificial-Intelligence-Assistant-using-Python-Athena-
Introducing Athena, my first Artificial Intelligence Assistant created using Python. Athena is a powerful tool that can understand and respond to various commands.
Her ability to quickly retrieve and provide relevant information about people, places, and events from Wikipedia is truly remarkable. 
Athena also has the capability to accurately tell time, making her a reliable virtual assistant. Furthermore, she can speak Sinhala,
adding a personal touch to her interactions. With Athena, you can even ask her to play videos on YouTube, making her a fun and versatile AI companion.
